## KNOWNET v2: Guided Health Information Seeking via Web Search Verification & Edge Uncertainty

A follow-up version of KNOWNET explores web search–based validation as an alternative to static knowledge-graph integration.  
This prototype introduces edge-level uncertainty quantification to assess the reliability of model-generated relations in real time.
