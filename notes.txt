Improve accuracy of diagrams
-Current issue, text on left side is too complicated and makes it hard to extrapolate diagrams.
-Note relations
-Algorithm gets confused by sentences like this
-Prompting engineering might be necessary
--Give good and bad examples
--Develop something easier to detect 
--Maybe only short sentences
Make left side and right side go at same time
-Make right side build progressively as gpt generates
-Add nodes in real time

Next thing: Try connecting front-end with back-end of graph database
Finish these tasks by end of summer.
